Python WhatsApp Scheduler

Description:

This Python script leverages the schedule and pywhatkit libraries to automate sending WhatsApp messages at a scheduled time.

Features:

Schedules WhatsApp messages for a specific day, hour, and minute.
Handles scheduling messages in the future even if the current time has passed the designated time.
Provides feedback on successful message delivery or errors.
Installation:

Clone this repository or download the code files.

Install the required libraries:

      Bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt


Modify the schedule_message function:

Replace the placeholders ('') with your actual:
number: The phone number of the recipient (in international format, including country code).
message: The message content you want to send.
hour: The hour (24-hour format) when you want to schedule the message.
minute: The minute (0-59) when you want to schedule the message.
Run the script:

Bash
python whatsapp_scheduler.py  # Replace 'whatsapp_scheduler.py' with your actual script name
Use code with caution.
Important Note:

Using this script to send unsolicited messages may violate WhatsApp's terms of service. Ensure you have the recipient's consent before using it.
WhatsApp may block automated messaging or accounts that exhibit suspicious activity. Use this script responsibly and ethically.

Additional Considerations:

You might want to add a section on how to handle potential errors (e.g., invalid phone number, network connectivity issues).
Consider creating a configuration file (e.g., config.ini) to store schedule settings and avoid modifying the script directly.
If you plan to distribute the script as a reusable package, provide instructions on packaging using tools like setuptools.
